          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a second-year Computer Science student at Stockholm University
            with a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics. My academic
            journey has taken a few turns — from studying Japanese and Business
            Economics to Civil Engineering — but it was through that exploration
            that I discovered my passion for Computer Science. I’m now fully
            immersed in programming and data analysis, working towards a future
            in <mark>data science</mark>.

          <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/343611">
            <p>
              “Comrades, there is no true social revolution without the
              liberation of women. May my eyes never see and my feet never take
              me to a society where half the people are held in silence. I hear
              the roar of women’s silence. I sense the rumble of their storm and
              feel the fury of their revolt.”

          <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/798801">
            <p>
              “I will not disgrace my religion, my people or myself by becoming
              a tool to enslave those who are fighting for their own justice,
              freedom and equality. If I thought the war was going to bring
              freedom and equality to 22 million of my people they wouldn’t have
              to draft me, I’d join tomorrow. I have nothing to lose by standing
              up for my beliefs. So I’ll go to jail, so what? We’ve been in jail
              for 400 years.”

      <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
      <p>
        As a child, I regularly appeared in several educational shows on Swedish
        television — including
        <em>UR’s WizQuiz</em>, <em>Newsreel</em>, and
        <em>SVT’s Hjärnkontoret</em>.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I’m a second-year Computer Science student at Stockholm University with a solid foundation in mathematics
                and statistics. My academic journey has taken a few turns — from studying Japanese and Business
                Economics to Civil Engineering — but it was through that exploration that I discovered my passion for
                Computer Science. I’m now fully immersed in programming and data analysis, working towards a future in
                <mark>data science</mark>.</p>

  <h2>Role Models</h2>
  <p>I draw inspiration from people who used their voice and platform to challenge the status quo. My greatest role models are <strong>Thomas Sankara</strong> and <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong>, whose courage, conviction, and commitment to justice continue to shape the way I think and live.</p>

  <!-- Thomas Sankara -->
  <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/343611">
    <p>“Comrades, there is no true social revolution without the liberation of women. May my eyes never see and my feet never take me to a society where half the people are held in silence. I hear the roar of women’s silence. I sense the rumble of their storm and feel the fury of their revolt.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <pre>
Thomas Sankara (1949–1987)
President of Burkina Faso (1983–1987)
Revolutionary leader, feminist, pan-Africanist
  </pre>

  

  <!-- Muhammad Ali -->
  <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/798801">
    <p>“I will not disgrace my religion, my people or myself by becoming a tool to enslave those who are fighting for their own justice, freedom and equality. If I thought the war was going to bring freedom and equality to 22 million of my people they wouldn’t have to draft me, I’d join tomorrow. I have nothing to lose by standing up for my beliefs. So I’ll go to jail, so what? We’ve been in jail for 400 years.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <pre>
Muhammad Ali (1942–2016)
Refused to fight in the Vietnam War on moral and religious grounds
Boxer, activist, cultural icon

        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <p>As a child, I regularly appeared in several educational shows on Swedish television — including <em>UR’s
                WizQuiz</em>
            and <em>Newsreel</em>, and <em>SVT’s Hjärnkontoret</em>.</p>
